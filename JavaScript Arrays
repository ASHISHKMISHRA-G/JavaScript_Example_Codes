 Non Primitive Types
- They are mutable types.
- They don't have a fixed range for value.
- The value range changes according to memory available.
- They are stored in a heap memory.
- You can access in random.

    1. Array
    2. Object
    3. Map
    4. Set (Obsolete)


                                Array
- Arrays are used in computer programming to reduce overhead and complexity.
- Array can reduce overhead by storing values in sequential order.
- Array reduces complexity by storing multiple values under one name.
- Array can handle different types of values in sequential order.
- Array size can change dynamically.

Note: Several programming languages restrict array to same type of values and
      will not allow to change the size dynamically.

- Array refers to an arrangement of values in specific sequence and allows access in random.
