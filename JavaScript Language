                                 Variables
- Variables are storage locations in memory where you can store a value and use it as
   a part of any expression.

- Variable configuration comprises of various phases.

        a) Declaration
        b) Initialization
        c) Assignment

- Declaration comprises of a keyword and variable name

        keyword  variableName;

        keyword    : It defines the behavior and rules.
        Name    : It is a memory reference name.

- JavaScript variables are declared by using following keywords
   
        a) var
        b) let
        c) const

- Variable assignment is the process of configuring a value into memory after declaration.

        var  age;            // declaring
        age = 30;            // assigning

- Initialization is the process of configuring a value into memory while declaring a variable.

        var age = 30;        // initialization

Note: Declaring variable is optional when JavaScript is not in strict mode. But it is not
      recommended to use JavaScript without strict mode.

var:
- It configures a function scope for variable.
- You can declare in any block of a function and access from any another block.
- It allows declaration, initialization and assignment.
   
Ex:
<script>
    "use strict";
     function f1()
     {
        var x;                  // declaration
        x = 10;                 // assignment
        if(x==10)
        {
            var y = 20;         // initializaiton
        }
        document.write("x=" + x + "<br>y=" + y);
     }
     f1();
</script>

 - It allows shadowing.
 - Shadowing is the process of re-declaring or re-initializing same name identifier with in the scope.
 - Shadowing allows to reset the allocated memory.

Syntax:
        var x = 10;        // initialization
        x=20;            // assignment
        x=30;            // assignment
        var x = 40;        // shadowing

 - Var allows hoisting.
 - Hoisting is the process of configuring the declaration and assignment with out any order dependency.
 - It allows to use and declare later.

Syntax:
        x = 10;
        document.write("x=" + x);
        var x ;                    // hoisting

let :
- It configures a block scope for variable.
- A block scope variable is accessible in the same block and its inner blocks.
- It allows declaring, assignment and initialization.
- It will not allow shadowing and hoisting.


const:
- It configures a block scope for variable.
- It allow only initialization.
- It will not allow declaration and assignment.
- It will not allow shadowing and hoisting.

Syntax:
        const x ;         // invalid
       
        const x = 10;
        x = 20;        // invalid
