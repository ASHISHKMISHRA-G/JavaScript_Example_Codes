                          JavaScript
- JavaScript is light weight interpreted and JIT compiled programming language.

- It is light weight as it occupies less memory.
- It is interpreted as it translates line-by-line of program.
- It is compiled as it can translate all lines simultaneously at the same time.
- It can use 2 types of compiling techniques
        a) JIT
        b) AOT
- JIT is Just-in-Time, which compiles in browser when it is requested in browser.
- AOT is Ahead-of-Time, which compiles at application and renders output in browser.

- JavaScript is a language that supports various programming approaches like
    a) Structural
    b) Functional

- JavaScript is used client side to reduce burden on server.
- It handles

    a) DOM Interactions
    b) BOM Actions
    c) Validations
    d) State   etc..

- DOM Interactions [Document Object Model]
    * Adding elements into page
    * Removing elements from page
    * Updating data into elements
    * Styling elements dynamically
    * Adding functionality to elements in page etc.

Evolution of JavaScript:

- CERN [Council for European Research & Nuclear] labs developed a script called "ECMA Script" for "Mosaic Browser" in early days of internet.

- Netscape Communications developed a browser called "Netscape Navigator" for internet.

- Netscape appointed "Brendan Eich" to design a client side script for their browser Netscape Navigator.

- Brendan Eich design a script by name "Mocha", later renamed as "Live Script".

- Netscape given the responsibility of Live Script to "Sun Microsystems".

- Sun Microsystems renamed Live Script to "JavaScript".

- In 2000 Netscape stopped its services, and given responsibility of JavaScript to ECMA.

- The latest version of JavaScript is  ECMA2024  [ES15]   June-2024
